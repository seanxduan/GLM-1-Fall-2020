# Packages needed:
install.packages("olsrr")
library(olsrr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Data used:
dat <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RipleyKyleR/public_data_files/master/Album%20Sales%202.dat")

# In this dataset, each row represents an album with the following variables:
# adverts - amount (in thousands of dollars) spent promoting the album before release
# sales - sales of the album (in thousands) the week after release
# airplay - number of times songs from the album played on the radio the week prior to release
# attract - attractiveness of the band on a scale from 0 (hideous potato-heads) to 10 (gorgeous sex objects)

#############
# Our Model #
#############

# Because we're focusing on simple one predictor regressions right now,
# we'll create a model that has album sales as the outcome and money
# spent on advertisements as the predictor.

mAdvert <- ___(___ ~ ___, data = ___)
___(mAdvert)

############
# Outliers #
############

# You've already learned some ways to identify outliers in your
# data during the lesson Tidying Data. However, now we will look
# at how to identify our outliers visually through scatterplots
# - which may be a bit easier to do. 

# I'll also take this opportunity to gently introduce you to the
# ggplot2 package from the tidyverse.

?ggplot

___(___ = ___, ___ = ___(___ = ___, ___ = ___)) + 
  ___() +
  ___(___ = "___", ___ = ___)

# Do you see any points that you think might be outliers?

############
# Leverage #
############

# Leverage values are useful for identifying abberant values,
# and we have a few ways to easily obtain and visualize
# those values in R.

# First, let's create a new variable in our data frame
# that contains the leverage value for each album.

dat$___ <- ___(___(mAdvert))

# We can then make a simple plot of these lever values
# to see if any observations have a much larger value
# than the other observations.

___(dat$lev)

# Looking at the plot, we can see that we have a few
# observations above .025 (a subjective value for this
# data that doesn't translate to other data). Let's 
# find out which observations those are.

ind <- ___(dat$lev > 0.025)
dat[ind,]

#################################
# Studentized Deleted Residuals #
#################################

# We can also use studentized deleted residuals to get an
# idea of influential observations in our data.

dat$stud_del_resid <- ___(mAdvert)

# We can get a handy plot of these values with the 
# `ols_plot_resid_stud()` function.

___(mAdvert)

# If we wish to make this plot without the default diagnostics,
# we can pull the necessary values and plot it ourselves.
# NOTE: we already pulled the studentized deleted residuals

dat$predicted <- ___(mAdvert)

___(dat$___,dat$___)

#################
# A Useful Plot #
#################

# We also have a plot that will look aat both leverage
# and studentized deleted residuals.

___(mAdvert)

###################
# Cook's Distance #
###################

# Cook's distance is also a useful diagnostic for our data.
# We can use these values much like we've used the previous.

dat$cooks_d <- ___(mAdvert) 

___(dat$___, ylab = "Cook's Distance")

# But we also have more useful plots.

___(mAdvert)

#################################
# Non-Normal Error Distribution #
#################################

# It's also a good idea to get an idea of the structure
# of your distribution of errors. We can do this easily
# by making a qq plot.

___(mAdvert$res) 
___(mAdvert$res)

# Ideally, you want the errors to fall on the line.

#################################
# Homogeneity of Error Variance #
#################################

# You also want to check that the error variances
# of your data are homogeneous.

# Will again go back to using ggplot2 for this graph.

___(___ = ___, mapping = ___(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  ___() + 
  ___(___ = "___", ___ = ___)

############################
# Removing Abberant Values #
############################

# You very rarely ever want to TRULY delete data. We can get around 
# this by just creating a new dataframe that doesnâ€™t include the 
# cases we choose to delete.

# This can be helpful in determining if removing these values 
# has a significant impact on your analyses.

dat_no_infl <- ___[-___(___, ___),]
